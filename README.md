ðŸ‘‹ Hello World! I'm Angel Vega, Iâ€™m a cybersecurity and cloud security professional whoâ€™s genuinely grateful to be part of such a dynamic and purpose-driven field. Whether responding to incidents, strengthening detection, or securing cloud environments, Iâ€™ve had the chance to grow through meaningful work and strong team collaboration.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work extensively across cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, leveraging tools such as Splunk, CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Sentinel, Sumo Logic, LogRhythm, and the D3 SOAR platform to support threat detection, response, and security operations. I hold certifications including Security+, CySA+, PenTest+, CASP+, AWS Security Specialty, and Azure Security Engineer Associate. Each detection, project, and cert has contributed to my growthâ€”and Iâ€™m especially thankful for the chance to learn from teammates, contribute to real-world defenses, and keep evolving in this fast-moving field.

What drives me most is the team: being able to collaborate, share knowledge, and support one another as we work to protect what matters. Iâ€™m always learningâ€”and excited to keep growing with others who are passionate about cloud and cybersecurity.

Letâ€™s connectâ€”especially if you value curiosity, integrity, and a proactive approach to security.
